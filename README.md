# Nexter
This repo consists of the code of project NEXTER which I made as a part of learning Advanced CSS course by Jonas Schmedtmann.
It is hosted on Netlify. It's designed by using advanced CSS Grid techniques.

### What all I learnt in this project?
> * Creating grids inside of grids
> * How to create a complex grid-looking gallery
> * Managing vertical spacing in a responsive
layout using CSS Grid techniques
> * Using object-fit together with images for grid
items
> * Building a rather complex component using a
mix of CSS Grid properties, overlapping and flexbox.
